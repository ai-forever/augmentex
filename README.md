# Augmentex ‚Äî a library for augmenting texts with errors
Augmentex introduces rule-based and common statistic (empowered by [KartaSlov](https://kartaslov.ru) project) 
approach to insert errors in text. It is fully described again in the [Paper](https://www.dialog-21.ru/media/5914/martynovnplusetal056.pdf)
and in this üó£Ô∏è[Talk](https://youtu.be/yFfkV0Qjuu0?si=XmKfocCSLnKihxS_).

## Installation
```commandline
pip install augmentex
```

## Implemented functionality
We collected statistics from different languages and from different input sources. This table shows what functionality the library currently supports.

|             | Russian     | English     |
| -----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| PC keyboard |      ‚úÖ     |      ‚úÖ     |
| Mobile kb   |      ‚úÖ     |      ‚ùå     |

In the future, it is planned to scale the functionality to new languages and various input sources.

## Usage
üñáÔ∏è Augmentex allows you to operate on two levels of granularity when it comes to text corruption and offers you sets of 
specific methods suited for particular level:
- **Word level**:
  - _replace_ - replace a random word with its incorrect counterpart;
  - _delete_ - delete random word;
  - _swap_ - swap two random words;
  - _stopword_ - add random words from stop-list;
  - _split_ - add spaces between letters to the word;
  - _reverse_ - change a case of the first letter of a random word;
  - _text2emoji_ - change the word to the corresponding emoji.
- **Character level**:
  - _shift_ - randomly swaps upper / lower case in a string;
  - _orfo_ - substitute correct characters with their common incorrect counterparts;
  - _typo_ - substitute correct characters as if they are mistyped on a keyboard;
  - _delete_ - delete random character;
  - _insert_ - insert random character;
  - _multiply_ - multiply random character;
  - _swap_ - swap two adjacent characters.

### **Word level**
```python
from augmentex import WordAug

word_aug = WordAug(
    unit_prob=0.4, # Percentage of the phrase to which augmentations will be applied
    min_aug=1, # Minimum number of augmentations
    max_aug=5, # Maximum number of augmentations
    lang="eng", # supports: "rus", "eng"
    platform="pc", # supports: "pc", "mobile"
    random_seed=42,
    )
```

1. Replace a random word with its incorrect counterpart;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
word_aug.augment(text=text, action="replace")
# Screw to guys, I to going com. (c)
```

2. Delete random word;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
word_aug.augment(text=text, action="delete")
# you I am home. (c)
```

3. Swap two random words;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
word_aug.augment(text=text, action="swap")
# Screw I guys, am home. going you (c)
```

4. Add random words from stop-list;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
word_aug.augment(text=text, action="stopword")
# like Screw you guys, I am going completely home. by the way (c)
```

5. Adds spaces between letters to the word;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
word_aug.augment(text=text, action="split")
# Screw y o u guys, I am going h o m e . (c)
```

6. Change a case of the first letter of a random word;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
word_aug.augment(text=text, action="reverse")
# Screw You guys, i Am going home. (c)
```

7. Changes the word to the corresponding emoji.
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
word_aug.augment(text=text, action="text2emoji")
# Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)
```

### **Character level**
```python
from augmentex import CharAug

char_aug = CharAug(
    unit_prob=0.3, # Percentage of the phrase to which augmentations will be applied
    min_aug=1, # Minimum number of augmentations
    max_aug=5, # Maximum number of augmentations
    mult_num=3, # Maximum number of repetitions of characters (only for the multiply method)
    lang="eng", # supports: "rus", "eng"
    platform="pc", # supports: "pc", "mobile"
    random_seed=42,
    )
```

1. Randomly swaps upper / lower case in a string;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
char_aug.augment(text=text, action="shift")
# Screw YoU guys, I am going Home. (C)
```

2. Substitute correct characters with their common incorrect counterparts;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
char_aug.augment(text=text, action="orfo")
# Sedew you guya, I am going home. (c)
```

3. Substitute correct characters as if they are mistyped on a keyboard;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
char_aug.augment(text=text, action="typo")
# Sxrew you gugs, I am going home. (x)
```

4. Delete random character;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
char_aug.augment(text=text, action="delete")
# crew you guys Iam goinghme. (c)
```

5. Insert random character;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
char_aug.augment(text=text, action="insert")
# Screw you ughuys, I vam gcoing hxome. (c)
```

6. Multiply random character;
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
char_aug.augment(text=text, action="multiply")
# Screw yyou guyss, I am ggoinng home. (c)
```

7. Swap two adjacent characters.
```python
text = "Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"
char_aug.augment(text=text, action="swap")
# Srcewy ou guys,I  am oging hmoe. (c)
```

### **Batch processing**
üìÅ For batch text processing, you need to call the `aug_batch` method instead of the `augment` method and pass a list of strings to it.

```python
from augmentex import WordAug

word_aug = WordAug(
    unit_prob=0.4, # Percentage of the phrase to which augmentations will be applied
    min_aug=1, # Minimum number of augmentations
    max_aug=5, # Maximum number of augmentations
    lang="eng", # supports: "rus", "eng"
    platform="pc", # supports: "pc", "mobile"
    random_seed=42,
    )

text_list = ["Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"] * 10
word_aug.aug_batch(text_list, batch_prob=0.5) # without action

text_list = ["Screw you guys, I am going home. (c)"] * 10
word_aug.aug_batch(text_list, batch_prob=0.5, action="replace") # with action
```

### **Compute your own statistics**
üìä If you want to use your own statistics for the _replace_ and _orfo_ methods, then you will need to specify two paths to parallel corpora with texts without errors and with errors.

Example of txt files:
<table>
<tr>
<th> texts_without_errors.txt </th>
<th> texts_with_errors.txt </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

some text without errors 1</br>
some text without errors 2</br>
some text without errors 3</br>
...

</td>
<td>

some text with errors 1</br>
some text with errors 2</br>
some text with errors 3</br>
...

</td>
</tr>
</table>

```python
from augmentex import WordAug

word_aug = WordAug(
    unit_prob=0.4, # Percentage of the phrase to which augmentations will be applied
    min_aug=1, # Minimum number of augmentations
    max_aug=5, # Maximum number of augmentations
    lang="eng", # supports: "rus", "eng"
    platform="pc", # supports: "pc", "mobile"
    random_seed=42,
    correct_texts_path="correct_texts.txt",
    error_texts_path="error_texts.txt",
    )
```
